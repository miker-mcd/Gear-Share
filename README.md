# GearShare

GearShare is a place where users can find the outdoor equipment items they need for their next outdoor adventure. Users can post items they are willing to share, allowing others to search for and reserve available items. After requests for reservations are approved, the item requester and owner coordinate the item pick up and return.

## Features

## Challenges
One of the biggest challenges we faced was learning and implementing Bootstrap. The team had limited experience with front-end frameworks and found Bootstrap to be flexible and less heavy-handed for the scope of our application. We had fun exploring Bootstrap's grid layout system and styles to set up elements including the navigation bar, modals and tabs. The end result is a more responsive and modern looking application.

Another challenge was planning and executing features within a limited amount of time. This was one of the few projects where as a group we would determine the features and purpose of the application versus Dev Bootcamp providing that structure to us. We had to be observant of time-constraints as well as ensuring that core features were completed before deciding to add another feature. We were ambitious in the beginning, but became more focused in our approach to delivering a final product. Our experience highlighted the importance of maintaining good product management workflow and communication while under pressure.
